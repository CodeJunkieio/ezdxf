Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages
by Christoph Gohlke, Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, University of California, Irvine.

This page provides 32- and 64-bit Windows binaries of many scientific 
open-source extension packages for the official CPython distribution 
of the Python programming language. A few binaries are available for 
the PyPy distribution.

The files are unofficial (meaning: informal, unrecognized, personal, 
unsupported, no warranty, no liability, provided "as is") and made 
available for testing and evaluation purposes.

Most binaries are built from source code found on PyPI or in the projects 
public revision control systems. Source code changes, if any, have been 
submitted to the project maintainers or are included in the packages.

Refer to the documentation of the individual packages for license restrictions 
and dependencies.
